# 4_hour-Workday-Strategy-Openai
I am utilizing a straightforward approach that involves both Langchain and OpenAI. By generating a transcript from a YouTube video, I am creating a four-hour workday plan strategy. This method is based on the guidance provided in the video.

This is the README.md file for the 4dws_yt_main.py file.

This file is a Streamlit implementation that shows how to create a strategy for a four-hour workday based on a YouTube Video.

We're using an easy Langchain implementation to show how to use the diffrent component of Langchain.

The is the part of Modeling Days learning. Find the details and code on my [Github](https://github.com/AKASH4148) 

Here are the steps on how to use this file:

1. First, install the dependencies by running the following command in the terminal:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Once the dependencies are installed, open the file in a code editor.

3. In the `url_input` variable, enter the URL of the YouTube video that you want to use.

4. Click the "Run" button.

5. The app will load the YouTube video transcript and split it into chunks.

6. The app will then initialize the language model and generate a strategy and plan based on the video transcript.

7. The strategy and plan will be displayed in the app.

I hope this helps!
